WHY DID I CHANGE LICENSE FROM MIT TO APACHE?

MIT is one of the most permissive free software licences. Basically, you can do
whatever you want with a software licensed under the MIT license, as long as you
add a copy of the original MIT license and copyright notice to it.

The Apache License is also a permissive license, nearly identical in terms of
what you can and cannot do, just more heavily "lawyered" and significantly more
verbose. However, there are three points it clearly states that were significant
to us:

  (1) that you cannot use names and marks of the original software (the app name,
      contributor names, icons, etc.) in any way that could lead others to
      believe that your distribution is endorsed by the us;

  (2) that any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in this
      project shall be under this same license without additional terms or
      conditions; and

  (3) that if you provide a modified version of this project you are required to
      keep a notice file (like this one) listing out all the modifications you
      have done in your version compared to the original software.

Apart from that, you can do anything with the software, including (but not
limited to) sublicensing, use a modified version for private purposes, and even
embed parts of the source in another product, all provided you retain any
original copyright notices and a copy of the Apache License related to this
work.
